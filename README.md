# Remote Prompt Manager (RPM)

No-Code service for handling fetching AI/Chat GPT prompts from a MongoDB instance.

## Why does this exist

Feature flags and remote configuration have spoiled us as developers. We're now finding that as Prompt Engineering gets more and more popular, pushing up code just shouldn't be required for every single prompt change.

It's slow, repetitive, and really just sucks ass.

## How does it work

Imitating the same great joys that feature flag systems gave us in the past.

- API and SDKs to remotely grab both Basic and Advanced (prompts with lots of custom data) AI prompts

- A dashboard to manage all of these prompts remotely

- A test environment to ensure our prompts are performing as good as we expect them to

## Why is this open source?

I'm a one man team, and I don't claim to be the smartest engineer in the room. But I'm good at bringing people together.

I think if we all work together, we can build a really cool service to solve all of our wants and desires for prompt engineering.
